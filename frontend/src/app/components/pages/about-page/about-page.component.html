        <p>The Philippines has been plagued with corruption in its government and criminality in its regions throughout the years which has greatly contributed to the low quality of life of its citizens. According to a recent survey, the country is ranked 27th in the least corrupt countries in Asia by Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and ranked 115th in the world. Compared to its neighboring countries like Singapore (ranked 1st in the least corrupt country in Asia and 5th in the world), the country has significantly lagged in the proper administration and governance of its resources and constituents. This is highly attributed to the country’s political malpractices and corruption of its high-ranking officials, resulting in a year-on-year increase in poverty rate with the country currently ranking 36th poorest country in the world. Additionally, the country is ranked 86th in Crime Rate in the world which is highly attributed to the country’s continuing problems with the notorious drug trade, human and arms trafficking, and poverty.</p>
        <p>The 16th goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to foster Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions across all countries. It focuses on promoting peace and inclusivity across different societal groups, providing easy access to justice for all world citizens, and creating effective and accountable governance at all levels.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to address the prevalent corruption, crime rate, and injustices in the country, this projects aims to align with the UN’s 16th SDG that promotes transparency in governance, easy access to public information, and legal services for all.</p>
